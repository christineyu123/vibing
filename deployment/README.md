---

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`)
- Docker installed

---

## 1. Create ECR Repositories

Replace `<your-aws-account-id>` and region as needed.

```sh
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name vibing-backend --region us-east-1
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name vibing-frontend --region us-east-1
```

---

## 2. Build Docker Images

```sh
bash deployment/build_images.sh
```

---

## 3. Push Images to ECR

Edit `deployment/push_ecr.sh` and set your AWS Account ID and region.

```sh
bash deployment/push_ecr.sh
```

---

## 4. Prepare ECS Task Definition

- Edit `deployment/ecs_task_definition.json`:
  - Replace `<BACKEND_IMAGE_URI>` and `<FRONTEND_IMAGE_URI>` with your ECR image URIs (from push step).

---

## 5. ECS Deployment (AWS Console UI)

After pushing your Docker images to ECR, you can deploy your app using AWS ECS. Below are step-by-step guides for both ECS Fargate and ECS EC2 launch types. Both methods use the AWS Console UI and deploy both frontend and backend containers.

---

### 5.1 Deploy with ECS Fargate (Recommended for Simplicity)

#### 1. Log in to AWS Console
- Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- Select your region (e.g., us-east-1).

#### 2. Create (or Use) a VPC, Subnet, and Security Group
- For Free Tier, you can use the default VPC and its subnets.
- Ensure your security group allows inbound HTTP (port 80) and, if needed, 5000 for backend.

#### 3. Create an ECS Cluster
- Go to **ECS** > **Clusters** > **Create Cluster**.
- Choose **Networking only (Fargate)**.
- Name: `vibing-fargate-cluster` (or your choice).
- Click **Create**.

#### 4. Create an IAM Role for Task Execution
- Go to **IAM** > **Roles** > **Create role**.
- Select **AWS service** > **ECS** > **ECS Task**.
- Attach the **AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy**.
- Name: `ecsTaskExecutionRole` (or your choice).
- Click **Create role**.

> **You will select this role as the "Task execution role" when creating the Task Definition in the next step.**

#### 5. Register a Task Definition
- Go to **ECS** > **Task Definitions** > **Create new Task Definition**.
- Launch type: **FARGATE**.
- Name: `vibing-fargate-task` (or your choice).
- Task role: (optional, for advanced features)
- Task execution role: **Select the IAM role you just created (`ecsTaskExecutionRole`)**.
- Network mode: `awsvpc`.
- Task size: 512 CPU, 1024 MiB memory (or adjust as needed).
- Add two containers:
  - **backend**:
    - Image: `<BACKEND_IMAGE_URI>` (from ECR)
    - Port mappings: 5000 (container and host)
    - Env: `FLASK_ENV=production`
    - **Log collection:** Under 'Storage and Logging', enable CloudWatch logs, create a new log group (e.g., `/ecs/vibing-backend`).
  - **frontend**:
    - Image: `<FRONTEND_IMAGE_URI>` (from ECR)
    - Port mappings: 80 (container and host)
    - **Log collection:** Enable CloudWatch logs, create a new log group (e.g., `/ecs/vibing-frontend`).
- Click **Create**.

#### 6. Create a Service
- Go to your cluster > **Services** > **Create**.
- Launch type: **FARGATE**.
- Task Definition: Select the one you just created.
- Service name: `vibing-fargate-service` (or your choice).
- Number of tasks: 1.
- Networking: Select your VPC, subnet, and security group.
- Assign public IP: **ENABLED**.
- Click **Create Service**.

#### 7. Access Your App
- Go to the **ECS Service** > **Tasks** > select the running task.
- Find the public IP in the ENI (Elastic Network Interface) details.
- Open `http://<public-ip>` in your browser (frontend on port 80).
- Backend will be on port 5000 if you open `http://<public-ip>:5000` and the security group allows it.

#### 8. Cleanup
- Go to **CloudFormation** > delete the stack created for your ECS service (if you used a stack), or manually delete the ECS service, cluster, and ECR repositories to avoid charges.

---

### 5.2 Deploy with ECS EC2 (Free Tier Eligible)

#### 1. Log in to AWS Console
- Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- Select your region (e.g., us-east-1).

#### 2. Create (or Use) a VPC, Subnet, and Security Group
- For Free Tier, you can use the default VPC and its subnets.
- Ensure your security group allows inbound HTTP (port 80) and, if needed, 5000 for backend.

#### 3. Create an ECS Cluster
- Go to **ECS** > **Clusters** > **Create Cluster**.
- Choose **EC2 Linux + Networking**.
- Name: `vibing-ec2-cluster` (or your choice).
- Instance type: `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible).
- Number of instances: 1 (or more if needed).
- Networking: Select your VPC, subnet, and security group.
- **EC2 Instance Role:** When prompted, select or create an IAM role named `ecsInstanceRole` (or similar) with the **AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role** policy attached. This allows EC2 instances to join the ECS cluster and pull images from ECR.
- Click **Create**.

#### 4. Create an IAM Role for Task Execution
- Go to **IAM** > **Roles** > **Create role**.
- Select **AWS service** > **ECS** > **ECS Task**.
- Attach the **AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy**.
- Name: `ecsTaskExecutionRole` (or your choice).
- Click **Create role**.

> **You will select this role as the "Task execution role" when creating the Task Definition in the next step.**

#### 5. Register a Task Definition
- Go to **ECS** > **Task Definitions** > **Create new Task Definition**.
- Launch type: **EC2**.
- Name: `vibing-ec2-task` (or your choice).
- Task role: (optional, for advanced features)
- Task execution role: **Select the IAM role you just created (`ecsTaskExecutionRole`)**.
- Network mode: `awsvpc`.
- Task size: 512 CPU, 1024 MiB memory (or adjust as needed).
- Add two containers:
  - **backend**:
    - Image: `<BACKEND_IMAGE_URI>` (from ECR)
    - Port mappings: 5000 (container and host)
    - Env: `FLASK_ENV=production`
    - **Log collection:** Under 'Storage and Logging', enable CloudWatch logs, create a new log group (e.g., `/ecs/vibing-backend`).
  - **frontend**:
    - Image: `<FRONTEND_IMAGE_URI>` (from ECR)
    - Port mappings: 80 (container and host)
    - **Log collection:** Enable CloudWatch logs, create a new log group (e.g., `/ecs/vibing-frontend`).
- Click **Create**.

#### 6. Create a Service
- Go to your cluster > **Services** > **Create**.
- Launch type: **EC2**.
- Task Definition: Select the one you just created.
- Service name: `vibing-ec2-service` (or your choice).
- Number of tasks: 1.
- Networking: Select your VPC, subnet, and security group.
- Assign public IP: **ENABLED**.
- Click **Create Service**.

#### 7. Access Your App
- Go to the **EC2 Instances** page.
- Find the public IP of the instance running your ECS task.
- Open `http://<public-ip>` in your browser (frontend on port 80).
- Backend will be on port 5000 if you open `http://<public-ip>:5000` and the security group allows it.

#### 8. Cleanup
- Go to **CloudFormation** > delete the stack created for your ECS service (if you used a stack), or manually delete the ECS service, cluster, and ECR repositories to avoid charges.

---

## 6. Access Your App

- Go to the EC2 instance public IP (or ECS service public endpoint) in your browser.
- Frontend: Port 80, Backend: Port 5000 (if exposed).

---

## Notes
- For Free Tier, use t2.micro EC2 instances and default VPC/subnet/SG.
- You can manage ECS/EC2 via AWS Console for easier networking setup.
- Make sure your security group allows inbound HTTP (80) and, if needed, 5000.
- **Docker image architecture:** If you build Docker images on a MacBook (Apple Silicon), the default architecture is arm64. ECS EC2 instances and Fargate tasks typically use x86_64 (amd64) by default. To avoid compatibility issues, either:
  - Build and push multi-architecture images (arm64 and amd64) using Docker Buildx, or
  - When creating your ECS cluster/service, select an ARM-compatible AMI/OS for EC2, or set the correct platform/architecture for Fargate tasks.
- If you see errors about platform incompatibility, check your image architecture and ECS instance/task settings.

---

## Cleanup
To avoid charges, delete ECS services, clusters, and ECR repos when done. 

---

## Local Testing (Run with Docker)

After building the Docker images, you can test the full app locally:

```sh
bash deployment/run_local.sh
```

- Backend will be available at: http://localhost:5000
- Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:8080

To stop the containers:

```sh
docker stop vibing-backend vibing-frontend
```
